        <h1>Links: What are they?</h1>
        <p>Links are a way to take the user from the current website, to either a different website or even another part of the same website. </p>
        
        <h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
        <p>Links use the tags "a" and require the attribute href, followed by = and the website URL, in order to tell the page where it is taking you. The text that follows the URL is what the user will see highlighted and what they click.</p>

        <h2>Types of Links</h2>
        <p>These are the types of link we will cover
            <ul>External link (another website)
                Example: <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a>
            </ul>
            <ul>Internal link (your own file)
                Example: <a href="lesson4.html">Go to Lesson 4</a>
            </ul>
            <ul>Open link in new tab (Optional but useful)
                Example: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Things to Remember</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>Do not forget https:// (www. will not be enough)</ul>
                <ul>Mispelling href</ul>
                <ul>Leaving the link text empty</ul>
                <ul>Linking to a file that does not exist</ul>
